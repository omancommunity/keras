## Deep learning using Keras:

This repo is to get start into how to make your model using different resources or dataset .
most resources or data set will be add as references down of this readme.md .
use this repo as you wish, you are more than welcome to add learning resources here.

hope things will be clear at the end .

#### Build Model :
To build your model you should do few steps, but one of important thing that you make sure or at least as possible dataset in numerical as possible, you will discover why after few tarin here and there, however, to build model follow these steps :
* analysis data make it stable to be load , using any libs for exa: pandas.
* define keras model .
* compile keras model .
* fit keras model .
* evaluate keras model .
* join all .
* make your predication .



---

#### libraries we will use :
pandas, keras, tensoflow if you have gpu try to install supported tensorflow support gpu and keras support gpu,
because it is a pain to make it with normal laptop as in my condition .
```bash
$ pip3 install pandas keras tensorflow 
```
if you are using conda :

```bash
$ conda install pandas keras tensorflow 
```



<small> you should use some scintific ready made product such as conda or any stable,ready packages collections .</small>
